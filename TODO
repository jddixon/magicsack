    INIT
    * need to generate two RSA 2048-bit private keys in PEM format		* DONE
        (skPriv and ckPriv)		                                        * DONE
    * these get AES-encrypted using the user's AES key and written		* DONE
        to .magicsack -- that is, to uDir		                        * DONE
        - these adds initialize the BuildList		                    * DONE
    * need routine to generate build list, encrypt it, and write it
        to disk
    * and the reverse function to read the build list from disk,
        decrypt it
        - this needs to be done with care, because the only mapping
            from file names to disk representation in the BuildList

    ADD
    * need library functions 
        - login using passphrase, from which system determines key
        - read existing BuildList
    * create copy of BUildList
    * find the file(s) being added, encrypt each, add to uDir, 
        updating copy with each operation
    * encrypt new BuildList, write to disk, rename the files so 
        replacement is semi-atomic operation

    LIST
    * login, get key, read BuildList as above
    * display as required
    * no further interaction with store

    * need function to insert subcommand name into help message         * DONE

    * FIX: testPKCS7.py fails                                           * DONE
    * crypto functions (pkcs7padding, test, etc) should be moved        * DONE
        to xlattice_py.crypto                                           * DONE

    * handleInit() needs
